# ClaimChain

##### Theme:  Financial Inclusion


Our idea is to implement a blockchain based solution to the insurance claim industry. We want to combine the current death registration and the death claims processes into a single, simplified  procedure requiring minimum intervention from multiple stakeholders.

Known Issues in the Current System:

1. Filing a death claim are long and tedious processes and takes a toll on the deceased's family.
2. Many claims are delayed up to six months, which can add to the trauma.
3. Good life insurance is only available to urban populace. The poor who need it the most are deprived of it.
4. There is excessive room for fraud due to multiple data sources.

The benefits of this approach include:

1. Fast Process: The claim time from start to finish is significantly reduced as lot of the processess will be automated.
2. Easier Process: Everything occurs over the blockchain network hence the process is easier with a clear paper trail and can be executed from anywhere over the network.
3. Less fraud: Since every transaction is done on blockchain, therefore it's transpaent and tracable.
4. Scalability: The proposed solution enables insurer to extend its services to large number to customers even those who don't live near urban setting.
